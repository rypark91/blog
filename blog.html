    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p id="intro">My name is Ryan Park.  I am a college graduate from the Univerity
    of Utah, and am currently learning how to do new things.  There are
  alot of companies out there who expect a lot from one person like myself.</p>

    <h3>My Story</h3>
    <p>I always wanted to make games for a long time.  So my journey
    to be a developer began in high school.  It was my senior year, and I was
    suggested by my counselor to take a tech class, which I did.</p>
    <p>I continued learning after I graduated from high school.  I took a few
    classes at the SLCC.  Big mistake on my part.</p>
    <p>I went on a 2 and a half year hiatus to serve a mission.  So I looked back
    on some old code to prepare myself for future classes.  I was still at SLCC
     at the time and continued with my classes.  I made the fatal mistake of
     learing from community college professors who took the whole sink or swim
     phiosophy to an extreme.</p>
     <p>I got accepted at the University of Utah and left SLCC.  After a semester
     of getting used to bigger college life, I decided to try and get into
     the computer science program.  In fact, there was a game development program
   that is actually an emphasis for either computer science or film at the time.
  I took some classes attempted to get into the program twice and failed.  So I
decided to retake on of my past classes to raise my GPA.  It still wasn't high enough,
but I still pleaded my case.  I finally got accepted in a program that's one of <thead>
  hardest to get in.
    <p>Once I got into the program, I went through college life.  I have taken a
    variety of classes.  Some not too bad, and others borderline spirit breaking.
  There were times when I had to retake some classes.  Still I did not give up.  <body>
    my senior year, I finished up my final classes, and walked during graduation.  I raised
    my fist in victory.</p>
    <p>So began my hunt for a job and a place in the world.  But I saw there is
    so much other things that were required despite me gaining the skills in
  college.  To make matters worse, apparantly I didn't get the credit on one of
 my classes.  So I pleaded for my case, proofed that my final project worked,
and got requalified for graduation.  Had to reapply though.  So I didn't get my
 acutal degree till the end of the year.  In the mean time, I job hunted and
learn some new skills, with web development being one of them.  When I'm not
coding, I work at a cabinet shop to earn money.  So, that's where I am and where
I've been.</p>
